        <div class="bio-content">
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</span>, better known as Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he came from a humble background and rose to become one of India's most beloved figures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kalam was instrumental in India's civilian space program and military missile development efforts. He played a pivotal role in India's <span class="highlight">Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998</span>, which established India as a nuclear power. His work on developing ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology earned him the title <span class="highlight">"Missile Man of India"</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was a passionate educator and motivational speaker. He believed in the power of youth and dedicated much of his post-presidency life to teaching and inspiring students across India. His vision for India was that of a developed nation, and he worked tirelessly to ignite young minds with dreams of innovation and progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Kalam authored several books, including the bestselling autobiography <span class="highlight">"Wings of Fire"</span> and "India 2020", outlining his vision for the country's development. He remained active until his last breath, collapsing while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong on July 27, 2015.
